Let's take a moment and congratulate ourselves on creating a successful little sailing club!\r\nI personally had a lovely time fixing and maintaining this boat, and taking you on sailing trips around the harbor and the coastal sea.\r\nWe saw many birds, jellyfish, ships, and lighthouses.\r\nI enjoyed restoring this old junker of a boat into a very capable (albeit a little unfinished) coastal cruiser.\r\n\r\nThe financial narrative for this boat was quite simple:\r\nNancy and I split the costs ~50-50 (it was expensive but it was worth it!) or so until May ‘16, at which point Nancy left town and I payed for the boat entirely out of my pocket.\r\nThis unfortunately cannot continue - it is simply outside of my financial reach, and is simply not cost effective for me to pay alone.\r\n\r\n## Okay, great, now let's talk about the future.\r\n\r\n### The budget\r\n\r\n* Maintenance : ~$1000/year, give or take, which I will continue to pay.\r\n* Insurance + taxes + fees : ~$350/ year, which I will continue to pay.\r\n* Winter storage : ~$1500 (total Nov - May)\r\n(this cost can be reduced to ~$1000 by keeping the boat in the icy water all winter, but may cause some expensive repairs next season)\r\n* Summer storage : $2500 (total May - Nov)\r\n\r\nWhile I can add an extra ~$100/month to what I already pay in order to cover the storage costs, this leaves some $230 per month in expenses I cannot possibly cover alone.\r\n\r\n### Okay, cool, so what?\r\n\r\nThe boat only makes financial sense if its costs are shared (affordable for 3 owners).\r\nI am now faced with a tough choice: to somehow pay for an entire year of the boat in the next few weeks, or to throw this boat into the trash.\r\n\r\n### Oh no! Not the trash! What can I do?\r\n\r\nIf you would like to co-own this boat (and take it sailing whenever you like), even without the hassle of having to maintain it, please consider sharing in its costs!\r\nI encourage you to step up and commit ~$100/month as well - very reasonable for owning a classic ocean-going boat in the most convenient marina in Boston!\r\n\r\nIf you absolutely cannot, but have enjoyed the boat in the past, I encourage you to pay your part for this enjoyment by contributing some cash every month.\r\nEven ~$20/month will go a long way.\r\nIf that's a lot, Ilia can make you a drink or two every month, which is what you’d spend drinking with him at a bar :D\r\nWe unfortunately are not very interested in one-time small donations, as these won’t significantly help with paying for the coming year.\r\n\r\nOf course, I am happy to sell out and put your name (or your company’s name!) on parts of this boat to promote your legacy!\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nIn order for this boat to continue existing, we must find a way to pay for the entire next year in storage fees in the near future.\r\nI will certainly do my part, but I ask that you do yours as well, and commit a few dollars per month for the upcoming year.\r\nI will keep you posted as we raise some money.\r\nIf lighting strikes, and we raise more than we expected, the money will stay with the boat and ensure it continues to be an affordable way for us all to go sailing!\r\n\r\nPlease tell all your friends, and don’t hesitate to forward this message to any interested parties.\r\n\r\nBest!\r\n-Ilia Lebedev\r\nMIT\r\n",
